## Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Set Up Supabase Project

1. **Create a new Supabase project** at https://supabase.com
2. **Note your credentials:**
   - Project URL: `https://your-project-id.supabase.co`
   - Service Role Key: Found in Settings > API

3. **Update `.env` file** with your actual credentials:
   ```env
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_actual_service_role_key_here
   ```

### Step 2: Create Supabase Storage Buckets

In your Supabase dashboard, go to Storage and create two buckets:

1. **quiz-images** (public bucket)
   - For quiz cover images and question images
   - Set to public access

2. **resumes** (public bucket)
   - For job application resumes
   - Set to public access

### Step 3: Run SQL Migration Script

1. Open Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy the entire contents of `server/supabase_rpc_functions.sql`
3. Paste and run the script
4. Verify all 12 RPC functions were created successfully

### Step 4: Migrate Your Database Schema

If you haven't already migrated your database schema from Cloud SQL:

1. Export schema from Cloud SQL:
   ```bash
   pg_dump --schema-only -h 34.39.52.34 -U enkel-laering-db-user enkel_laering > schema.sql
   ```

2. Import to Supabase via SQL Editor
3. Verify all tables, constraints, and foreign keys are present

### Step 5: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install supabase
```

### Step 6: Test the Migration

Run your application in a test environment and verify:

- ✅ All database operations work
- ✅ Image uploads return public URLs
- ✅ Admin validation works correctly
- ✅ Complex queries (JOINs, window functions) work via RPC
- ✅ Storage operations (upload, delete) work

### Step 7: Deploy to Production

Once testing is complete:

1. Update production `.env` with Supabase credentials
2. Deploy the updated code
3. Monitor for errors in the first 24 hours

## Key Changes & Important Notes

### Schema Changes

#### New/Modified Columns:
1. **`about_me_texts.image_url`** (TEXT) - **NEW COLUMN**
   - Stores public URL of teacher profile images

2. **`questions.image_url`** (TEXT) - **RENAMED** from `image`
   - Stores public URL of question images

3. **`quizzes.image_url`** (TEXT) - **RENAMED** from `image`
   - Stores public URL of quiz cover images

### Storage Changes

#### Before (Google Cloud Storage):
```python
# Uploaded to GCS, stored path in database
upload_image(file) → "gs://bucket/path" → database
```

#### After (Supabase Storage):
```python
# Upload to Supabase, get public URL, store in database
supabase.storage.upload(file) → get_public_url() → database
```

**Important:**
- All image upload functions now return **public URLs** instead of file paths
- Update any route handlers that use these functions to expect URLs
- Image URLs are automatically public (no signed URLs needed)

### Query Pattern Changes

#### Simple Queries (Direct Supabase Client)
```python
# Before (psycopg2)
sql = "SELECT * FROM teachers WHERE user_id = %s"
execute_query(sql, (user_id,))

# After (Supabase)
supabase.table('teachers').select('*').eq('user_id', user_id).execute()
```

#### Complex Queries (RPC Functions)
```python
# Before (psycopg2 with JOINs)
sql = """
    SELECT s.* FROM students s
    JOIN teacher_student ts ON s.user_id = ts.student_user_id
    WHERE ts.teacher_user_id = %s AND ts.teacher_accepted_student = TRUE
"""
execute_query(sql, (teacher_id,))

# After (Supabase RPC)
supabase.rpc('get_student_for_teacher', {'teacher_id': teacher_id}).execute()
```

### Admin Validation Pattern

#### Before (Single Query with EXISTS):
```python
sql = """
    UPDATE students SET is_active = FALSE
    WHERE user_id = %s
      AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM teachers WHERE user_id = %s AND admin = TRUE)
"""
```

#### After (Two Queries):
```python
# Check admin first
admin = supabase.table('teachers').select('admin').eq('user_id', admin_id).execute()
if not admin.data or admin.data[0]['admin'] != 'TRUE':
    raise ValueError("User is not an admin")

# Then update
supabase.table('students').update({'is_active': 'FALSE'}).eq('user_id', user_id).execute()
```

## RPC Functions Reference

All 12 RPC functions are defined in `supabase_rpc_functions.sql`:

| Function Name | Purpose | Use Case |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `get_student_for_teacher` | Get students for a teacher | Multi-table JOIN |
| `get_teacher_for_student` | Get teachers for a student | Multi-table JOIN |
| `get_new_orders_for_teacher` | Get pending orders for teacher | 3-table JOIN |
| `get_students_with_few_classes` | Get students with few recent classes | Window function (ROW_NUMBER) |
| `get_students_without_teacher` | Get unassigned students | Complex NOT IN + JOIN |
| `get_all_students_without_teacher` | Admin version of above | Admin validation |
| `insert_classes_batch` | Insert multiple classes atomically | Transaction safety |
| `alter_new_student` | Update new student (16 fields) | Dynamic update |
| `update_new_order_dynamic` | Update order with optional fields | Dynamic update |
| `delete_quizzes_cascade` | Delete quiz + questions + results | Multi-table delete |
| `set_classes_invoiced_batch` | Batch invoice classes | Batch update |

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test these critical operations:

### Database Operations
- [ ] Get all teachers (simple SELECT)
- [ ] Get student for teacher (RPC with JOIN)
- [ ] Insert a new teacher (INSERT)
- [ ] Update teacher profile (UPDATE)
- [ ] Delete a review (DELETE)

### Storage Operations
- [ ] Upload quiz image → verify public URL is returned
- [ ] Upload teacher profile image → verify stored in database
- [ ] Upload resume → verify public URL is returned
- [ ] Delete quiz → verify storage folder is deleted

### Admin Operations
- [ ] Admin can view all students
- [ ] Admin can update student notes
- [ ] Admin can set classes to invoiced
- [ ] Admin can set classes to paid
- [ ] Non-admin receives error when trying admin operations

### Complex Operations
- [ ] Insert multiple classes (transaction)
- [ ] Get students with few classes (window function)
- [ ] Get students without teacher (NOT IN query)
- [ ] Update new order with dynamic fields
- [ ] Delete quiz with cascade (multi-table)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur in production:

1. **Immediate Rollback:**
   - Revert `.env` to use old Cloud SQL credentials
   - Deploy previous version of code
   - Cloud SQL database is still intact

2. **Data Migration (if needed):**
   - Export data from Supabase
   - Import back to Cloud SQL
   - Verify data integrity

---

## Performance Considerations

### Improvements:
- ✅ Built-in connection pooling (Supabase handles this)
- ✅ Faster queries via RPC functions (single round-trip)
- ✅ CDN-backed storage for images

### Monitor:
- Query response times (check Supabase dashboard)
- Storage bandwidth usage
- RPC function performance

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"User is not an admin" errors**
   - Check that admin field is 'TRUE' (string, not boolean)
   - Verify admin user_id is correct

2. **Storage upload fails**
   - Verify buckets exist: `quiz-images` and `resumes`
   - Check buckets are set to public
   - Verify SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is correct

3. **RPC function not found**
   - Verify you ran the entire `supabase_rpc_functions.sql` script
   - Check function names match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - Use Supabase dashboard > Database > Functions to verify

4. **Import errors**
   - Verify `supabase` package is installed: `pip install supabase`
   - Check `supabase_client.py` is in the correct location
   - Verify `.env` file is being loaded
